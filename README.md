## A collection of projects crafted during my learning journey

The curriculum is project-based, and students learn by solving real-world problems, fostering self-discipline, collaboration, and creativity. It's like Hogwarts, but with more debugging.

### What I Did:
- **ðŸš€ Tackled Projects:** Built apps that (mostly) worked and solved problems I didnâ€™t even know existed.
- **ðŸ¤¯ Faced Brain-Bending Challenges:** The kind that made me think, "Wait, how does this even work?!"
- **ðŸ’» Mastered Late-Night Coding:** Because bugs donâ€™t sleep, and apparently, neither did I.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Google is your best friend.** Itâ€™s like having a superpower at your fingertips.
- **Debugging is an art.** And like any great artist, I spent 90% of my time questioning my life choices.
- **Collaboration is key.** Two brains are better than one, especially when untangling tricky code.
